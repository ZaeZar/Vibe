# HALLO

I have setup the basic structure of the project here. You will see that I made a file for literally everything,
and that's actually needed because it will be easier to edit and add things later on.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`please do follow the same folder structure :)`
